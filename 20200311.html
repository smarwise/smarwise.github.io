                                <p>As programmers, we are hardly the most social people on the planet. Most of us got into programming because it doesn't involve other people, it's mostly you and your computer. Yes, we can socialize but that doesn't mean that we always want to. Which makes it a lot harder for us to network and to make connections but this does not mean that networking is not important for us.</p>	
								<p>Suppose you are 15 years old and and you are a good guitar player. After school, you rush home and you practice your guitar and you're getting really good at it. You have dreams of becoming an international sensation one day but for now it is but a dream. A music competition comes to town and since you do not know about it, you stay at home playing your guitar in your room.</p>
								<p>Now suppose you're the same 15 year old. You attend small music events around town and you know a few other instrument players. You get together sometimes and you play together and give each other tips on how to play better. The different perspectives and tips help you to improve even faster. When the music competition comes into town one of your colleagues learns about it and they let you know. The even suggest that you form a band so you can play together at this competition. You participate together and you do not win but you get experience performing in front of a lot of people and your skills keep improving as the months go by. You're already doing much better than the person who is good but has no connections.</p>
								<p>Likewise, as a programmer, having connections will help improve your skills in the field and it will also help you to know about and have access to certain opportunities or information. If you are a freelancer, networking might help you land a few jobs.  It's not easy to start networking if you are someone who's never had to do it but in programming circles it's actually easier to network. </p>
								<h1>Here are some things that you can do to start networking:</h1>
								<h3>1. Attend tech related conferences</h3>
								<p>Tech related conferences are the best way to meet people and it's a great way to learn of new things that you might not know are happening in the tech world. It will help you to stay current about the changes happening and it helps you to prepare yourself accordingly. You also get to meet people with the same interests as yourself.</p>
								<h3>2. Attend hackathons</h3>
								<p>Hackathons are great especially when you have no team. You can form a team at the hackathon with these people you have never met before and by the time you are done coding for 36 hours or 48 hours, you know these people and you've already added these great people to your circle.</p>
								<h3>3. Get to know your coworkers</h3>
								<p>Your coworkers are a great place to get information especially relating to the field you work because they know more than the rest of the people the information that would be useful to you. When you get along with your coworkers you would be surprised at how much information they know and how much you can learn from them.</p>
								<h3>4. Join the right online forums</h3>
								<p>There are a lot of online platforms that provide a lot of support to programmers. they are online platforms for almost every programming language out there. You can learn a lot from this forums and you can meet a lot of people on these platforms as well.</p>	
								<p>Making connections is not easy because networking is not easy but if you are ever in need of a job or field related help, it comes in handy. There are many ways to network and I listed the easiest four. You can do it whichever way works for you and you will see immense improvement. The great thing about having connections is that you also become a connection and you're able to make a positive impact in those people's lives.</p>
