                                <p>Finally, after all those years in school, you have made it to the end. Cap on, people cheering, you did it, you graduated. As the excitement wears off, you realize that this is it, your career is officially underway and like any other person, you want to be perfect. You may already have an offer from your favorite company or you are just opening those job advertisements but whichever way you go, your choice of company will make all the difference. Now that you have a job lined up, you wonder how work is going to be like. You imagine yourself doing all the work on time, never doing anything wrong, and knowing everything. Maybe that is possible, for 1% of the population but for the rest of us, here’s what life as a graduate developer really looks like.</p>
                                <p>Being new, you will join a team. More often than not, you will get placed on a project with some languages and technologies that you have never heard of before but that’s the beauty of being a programmer, you can learn anything given enough time and resources. Good time management skills become critical as you begin your journey as a software developer because it’s more than just code now, you have meetings, events, and emails to attend to. </p>
                                <p>Your typical day would look something like this. You walk into work, meeting a few people on your way to your desk. You do the usual, get a cup of coffee, login, and just like that, your day begins. You are greeted by a few emails and meeting invitations that you quickly respond to. You run your code, making sure it still works because, for some weird reason, code loves to break the following morning. Reassured, you head over to your morning standup where you discuss your goals for the day. With more clarity, you now start coding. </p>
                                <p>You feel invincible like a hacker in a movie, but that’s just until you realize that you have hit a dead end. After scrolling on the internet for a while and still not finding what you are looking for, you give up and for the fifth time that day you text your teammate, “Hey, could you please come look at my code, I have no idea what I am doing wrong.” They come over and in a matter of minutes, you are coding again but just for a little while because you have a meeting in 5. This is the cycle your day goes in, coding, browsing the internet, asking for help, coding again, meetings, and answering emails.</p>
                                <p>After all is done, when you reach the end of your day and you finally enter that “git push”, there is no comparing the feeling of accomplishment you get because even though your code is not perfect, you have made significant progress and learnt something new so you are proud of yourself. You walk out smiling because you know, all it takes to be a developer is a willingness to learn, ask questions, put in the work, and accept advice. You will make mistakes, a lot of them, but that’s okay because you don’t have to be perfect, you just have to do your best, and that is what the life of a junior developer really looks like.</p>
