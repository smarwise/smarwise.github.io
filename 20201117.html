                                <p>When I joined the working world, I was sure that I would be learning and doing my work from the office. Two weeks into my first month at my new job, the pandemic started. The world went into lockdown and I was officially introduced into the world of remote working. Remote working had always been a concept to me but now it was a reality. At first remote working was just something that we were doing as we waited for the world to open up again but we soon realised that this was our new normal. Needless to say, I've learned a few things in the past year of working from home.</p>
								<h3>The good…</h3>
								<p>The first thing that I learnt was that working from home is so convenient. I never considered remote working before this and to be fair, not many jobs allowed for it but since the pandemic started, more jobs have been offering a remote option. One thing I love the most about working from home is the fact that I can be more productive. I am less tired since I do not have to travel and sit in traffic for hours. I can wake up 2 hours later than I usually did and be on time for work and also well-rested. I never realised that commuting home after a very long day at work was adding to my fatigue. On the other hand, only logging out of work when remote working ensures that I go from work to home in a couple of minutes.</p>
								<p>An interesting benefit of working from home has been that I have more time and energy to do the things that I want to do. I do a lot of things outside of work. From the more complicated hobbies like writing or learning a language to the simpler day-to-day needed tasks like cooking and other chores. Usually, doing these things would be difficult since I would be so tired but now I can easily do them without having to wake up extra early to do them before work.</p>
								<h3>The bad…</h3>
								<p>Working from home has not been all rosy though. I had to adjust to doing work at home because I could easily get into work mode when I get to the office but it took adjusting for that to happen when working from home. I had to set my body into work mode during specific times so I was able to do my work. Once I passed that hurdle, everything else was a little easier to do. Remote working requires a little more effort to concentrate on your work when you start but the lack of distractions at home also makes it a little easier to concentrate once you start.</p>
								<p>Working from home is definitely not for everyone. I can easily advocate for it right now because I have a quiet space at home to work in and no one lingering around to disturb. I don't know if I would feel the same if I had kids running around or people staying with me who were a little loud. Others also just prefer to have people around as it helps them concentrate and for them working in the office is definitely the right choice.</p>
								<h3>And the verdict.</h3>
								<p>I love remote working but I also love going into the office and socializing with my coworkers. I wouldn't mind going into the office and working from there but I think the perfect setup for me would allow for me to work at home and also for me to head into the office whenever I needed it. Remote working is awesome but understandably, it's not for everyone.</p>
