								<p>In January 2020, I graduated from college. I was most excited about starting my career and finally putting my skills to use. In March 2020, I started a new job, exciting times! Here are 5 things I have learnt in the past year.</p>
								<h1>1. I knew more than I thought I did. </h1>
                                    <p>As a junior developer, I knew I had a lot to learn but I also put down how much I knew. In my head, I just thought I didn’t know much. I remember my mentor echoing the same thing I know now, “You know a lot more than you think”. I didn’t believe it at the time but the more I solved random problems, the more confidence I gained. Now I believe in myself and my skills. If you are starting out, just remember that you know a lot more than you think!
                                    </p>
                                <h1>2. Ask as many questions as you need to</h1>
                                <p>Now we’ve all been told many times that we should ask questions but no one ever tells us to ask as many questions as we need to. I emphasize this because sometimes I ask a question and the answer leaves me more confused than not. At this point, I feel embarrassed to ask any more questions and I pretend to understand. I then get stuck for the whole day on something I could have had clarified in a couple of minutes. Ask as many questions as you need to do your work. Don’t fear looking clueless, in fact just accept that you don’t know certain things, yet, and you will be just fine.</p>
                                <h1>3. You will not just code</h1>
                                <p>This is exactly like it sounds. I coded a lot when I was in school. I did have team meetings and school events but they did not take up much time. In the work world, there is a lot of meetings involved and so many emails and events. These take up a good hour or two out of your workday. Yeah, you may love to code but you also learn to get used to all the other aspects involved.
                                </p>
                                <h1>4. Never make a promise to be done with something on a specific day or time</h1>
                                <p>Now I am not saying that you shouldn’t have goals and deadlines. I am just saying that you should remember that coding is not linear, you may estimate how much time it might take to accomplish certain goals but that estimate is not guaranteed. I have estimated that something might take me an hour and it ended up taking me a whole day to complete. I have also budgeted a whole day for certain things and they only took me half an hour. That is something to keep in mind. In the beginning, I’d make promises and I’d stay up all night to fulfill them, which didn’t work out long term.</p>
                                <h1>5. Have fun</h1>
                                <p>Take a break, have a coffee or a conversation, and build good work relationships. You are at work for 40 hours a week, the least you can do is have fun whilst doing it!</p>
