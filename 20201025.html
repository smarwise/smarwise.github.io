                                <p>Today, I thought I’d share a little more about my mentorship experience. Late in 2019, a friend sent me a link to a LinkedIn post. The lady who made the post was looking for a recent graduate to mentor for the year 2020. I’m never one to shy away from an opportunity so I jumped at it with open arms. I sent in my application and later got an email notifying me that I had been chosen from the pool of applicants. When January 2020 rolled around, we had our first mentoring meeting and it only went uphill from there. I have taken some time to explain some reasons why I recommend finding a mentor or becoming one. The two are not mutually exclusive, so you can do both.</p>
                                <h1>As a mentee:</h1>
                                <h3>1. You will learn a lot</h3>
                                <p>Instead of flying blind, I had my mentor’s experiences and advice to guide me through some of the most confusing parts of the year. I believe this just made me a better person and a great employee in general.</p>
                                <h3>2. You have your own personal cheerleader</h3>
                                <p>2020 was not an easy year for me but there was nothing more encouraging than having someone tell you “You can do it” when I doubted myself or “I’m so proud of you” when I made a little progress.</p>
                                <h3>3. They can grant you access to their connections</h3>
                                <p>I saw this in action when I was looking for a job. My mentor let the people she had in her connections know that I was looking for a job and I got invited to a few interviews. This was great as I had no such connections myself.</p>
                                <h3>4. They can vouch for you</h3>
                                <p>It’s always great to have someone to vouch for you when it’s needed.</p>
                                <h3>5. They become a friend</h3>
                                <p>As much as all of the above is great, the best part is you connect. You become friends with your mentor. At first, she was just the lady I met on LinkedIn but now she is the amazing lady I am so grateful I got the chance to know. My mentor is my inspiration, and I hope that I made at least half as much of a difference in her life as she did in mine and that I can take the things she taught me and pass them on to others.</p>
                                <h1>As a mentor:</h1>
                                <p>I have never been a mentor but I have some insight from some conversations I have had with my mentor.</p>
                                <h3>1. You make a difference in someone’s life</h3>
                                <p>I know my mentor did.</p>
                                <h3>2. It reminds you of how far you’ve come</h3>
                                <p>I can’t count how many times I’ve heard my mentor start a sentence with “This reminds me of this one time that I …...”</p>
                                <h3>3. You become a better leader/coach</h3>
                                <p>This is a great way to build up your leadership skills.</p>
                                <h3>4. Its a great way to get recognized as a leader in your field</h3>
                                <p>Anyone who is able to mentor someone in a specific field only shows that they are good at it and are doing well themselves.</p>
                                <h3>5. It helps you to learn of things you might never have</h3>
                                <p>How things are done always changes and there is something to learn from the others walking a path after you. Their fresh perspectives might be beneficial.</p>
								<p>All this really goes to say that mentorship is an amazing concept and I’d highly recommend it. I’m enjoying my time being mentored and I know you would too, whether you are a mentor or mentee!</p>
